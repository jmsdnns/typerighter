.. rubric:: Data Types for Cynical Humans.

Welcome to TypeRighter, a project that wants to make it easier to deal with
data that is messier than we'd prefer.

Overview
========

A user can create *types* or *records* and use those to validate data, convert
it to and from native Python types, or adjust its structure somehow.

TypeRighter is a fundamentally a system for structuring data such that it can
be used inside Python's metaprogramming API.

If you are new to TypeRighter, the quickstart guide should be your first stop.

Happy hacking.
